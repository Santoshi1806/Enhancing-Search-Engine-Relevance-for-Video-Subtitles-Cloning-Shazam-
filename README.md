# 🎵 **Shazam Clone: Audio Transcription & Subtitle Search**  

## 🚀 **Overview**  
This project builds an AI-powered **search engine** for audio-to-text conversion and interactive search applications. It leverages **speech-to-text models, vector embeddings, and search engine technologies** to enhance media analysis and information retrieval.  

🔗 **Deployment URL:** _Shazam Clone Search Engine_  

---

## 🎯 **Objective**  
Develop an **advanced search engine algorithm** that efficiently retrieves subtitles based on user queries. This system leverages **NLP and machine learning** to improve search relevance and accuracy.  

### **Keyword-Based vs. Semantic Search**  
🔹 **Keyword-Based Search:** Matches exact keywords between queries and indexed documents.  
🔹 **Semantic Search:** Understands the meaning and context of queries beyond keyword matching using embeddings.  

---

## 🔍 **Core Logic**  
The search engine follows these steps to compare user queries with subtitle documents:  

### 1️⃣ **Preprocessing the Data**  
✔ Extract and clean subtitle data (remove timestamps, punctuation, etc.).  
✔ Subset the dataset (e.g., use 30% of data if compute resources are limited).  

### 2️⃣ **Generating Text Vectors**  
Convert subtitle text into **vector embeddings** using:  
📌 **TF-IDF / Bag of Words (BoW)** → For keyword-based search.  
📌 **BERT-based SentenceTransformers** → For semantic search.  

### 3️⃣ **Implementing a Document Chunker**  
✔ Split subtitles into smaller chunks to maintain context.  
✔ Use **overlapping windows** to prevent information loss.  

### 4️⃣ **Storing Embeddings in ChromaDB**  
✔ Store **vector representations** of subtitle chunks in **ChromaDB** for efficient retrieval.  

### 5️⃣ **Retrieving Documents Based on User Query**  
✔ Convert user **audio query to text** using **AssemblyAI or other ASR models**.  
✔ Vectorize the text query & compute **cosine similarity** with subtitle embeddings.  
✔ Rank and return the **most relevant subtitle segments**.
